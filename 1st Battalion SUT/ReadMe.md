Welcome to the TacticalGaming 1st Battalion SUT section. This section includes files from the 1st Battalion's game servers for all operations. Please ask for permission before use of our file. Thank you.
If you have any questions you can visit us at http://www.tacticalgaming.net/hq for more info.

For making a quick mission there a few key files you'll need to use in the file. Take the "Use_this_shit.zip" file and extract it into your mission. Make sure you take the modules from an existing mission file that is used and place it onto the map. Also make sure that there are play slots to spawn onto.

If you're spawning onto a carrier I would suggest placing the blank "respawn_west" marker anywhere on the map then going into the mission.sqm and copy the same position as one of the units on the carrier as the position for the respawn_west marker.

## To-do
    - Make/remake all missions with the new standard loadouts and modules.
